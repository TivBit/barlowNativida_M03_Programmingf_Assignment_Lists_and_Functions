A program that capitalizes certain words in a list.

This program was designed to capitalize certain words in a list.  The following bug report explains what went right and what went wrong. (1). I was able to print out the list, but all elements were in lowercase.  (2).  When I was able to print out the name 'cinderella', it came out in all caps and was not accompanied by the rest of the list.  (3).  I had the same issue with the words 'mozerella' (which printed out 3 times) and 'salmonella' (which printed out once).  I think the list should have been appended, but I couldn't seem to figure out the logic.  Looking forward to feedback.
