A program that capitalizes certain words in a list.

The first program was designed to capitalize certain words in a list.  The following bug report explains what went right and what went wrong. (1). I was able to print out the list, but all elements were in lowercase.  (2).  When I was able to print out the name 'cinderella', it came out in all caps and was not accompanied by the rest of the list.  (3).  I had the same issue with the words 'mozerella' (which printed out 3 times) and 'salmonella' (which printed out once).  I think the list should have been appended, but I couldn't seem to figure out the logic.  Looking forward to feedback.

The second program was designed to define a function and then print out the names #on a list when the function "good" is called.  No bugs to report.

The third program was designed with a generator function that returns the odd numbers #from range(10) Using a for loop to find and print the third value returned.  The bug to report is that I was able to print the list of odd numbers, but was unable to isolate and print only the third value.  Instead, values '1, 3, 5, 7, 9' printed.
